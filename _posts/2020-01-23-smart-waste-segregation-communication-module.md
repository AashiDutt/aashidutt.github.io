Hello everyone. Thanks for continuing with this post. In the last post we saw how to take our trained model, optimize it for size and speed as well as deploy it on Android/Embedded device. 

In this post, we'll continue with the deployed model code and add the code for communication  module that will communicate the result as well as relay the commands for controlling the lid of the appropriate bin. So, let's get started.

# HTTP Client/Server working in Brief

// Explain how HTTP Client protocol works with  diagrams/images

# Communication Module in Code

// Explain Arduino/ESP HTTP and Android Code with images/code.

# Validating the Communication Module

// Test commnication module by sending a sample command from Android to ESP.

# Outro

Thanks for reading.
