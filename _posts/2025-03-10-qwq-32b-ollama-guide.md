## Why Run QwQ-32B Locally?

Despite its size, QwQ-32B can be quantized to run efficiently on consumer hardware. Running QwQ-32B locally gives you complete control over model execution without dependency on external servers.

**Advantages**:
- Privacy & security
- Uninterrupted access
- Faster performance
- More customization
- Cost efficiency
- Offline availability

## Setting Up QwQ-32B Locally With Ollama

### Step 1: Install Ollama

Download and install from [Ollama's official website](https://ollama.com).

### Step 2: Download and Run QwQ-32B

```bash
ollama run qwq:32b
```

Or use the quantized version:

```bash
ollama run qwq:Q4_K_M
```

### Step 3: Serve QwQ-32B in the Background

```bash
ollama serve
```

---

## Using QwQ-32B Locally

### Step 1: Inference via CLI

```bash
ollama run qwq
```

Then type a prompt like:

```text
How many r's are in the word "strawberry”?
```

### Step 2: Using Ollama API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "model": "qwq",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain Newton second law of motion"}], 
  "stream": false
}'
```

### Step 3: Using Python

Install the Ollama package:

```bash
pip install ollama
```

Then run:

```python
import ollama
response = ollama.chat(
    model="qwq",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain Newton's second law of motion"}],
)
print(response["message"]["content"])
```

## Running a Logical Reasoning App With QwQ-32B Locally

### Step 1: Prerequisites

```bash
pip install gradio ollama
```

### Step 2: Query Function

```python
import ollama
import re

def query_qwq(question):
    response = ollama.chat(
        model="qwq",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": question}]
    )
    full_response = response["message"]["content"]
    think_match = re.search(r"<think>(.*?)</think>", full_response, re.DOTALL)
    think_text = think_match.group(1).strip() if think_match else "Thinking process not explicitly provided."
    final_response = re.sub(r"<think>.*?</think>", "", full_response, flags=re.DOTALL).strip()
    return think_text, final_response
```

### Step 3: Gradio Interface

```python
import gradio as gr

interface = gr.Interface(
    fn=query_qwq,
    inputs=gr.Textbox(label="Ask a logical reasoning question"),
    outputs=[gr.Textbox(label="Thinking Process"), gr.Textbox(label="Final Response")],
    title="QwQ-32B Powered: Logical Reasoning Assistant",
    description="Ask a logical reasoning question and the assistant will provide an explanation."
)
interface.launch(debug=True)
```
