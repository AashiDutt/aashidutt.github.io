**[Read the full article on DataCamp: Model Context Protocol (MCP): A Guide With Demo Project](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/mcp-model-context-protocol)**

Learn how to build a **PR review server** using **Anthropicâ€™s Model Context Protocol (MCP)** that connects Claude Desktop with GitHub and Notion for dynamic code analysis and documentation.

---

## Overview

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard introduced by Anthropic to streamline communication between language models and external tools such as APIs, databases, or applications like GitHub and Notion.

In this tutorial, you'll build a complete **MCP-based PR Review system** where Claude Desktop acts as the AI agent analyzing pull requests. It connects with GitHub to fetch code diffs and stores review summaries to Notion â€” all using MCPâ€™s standardized server-client interface.

---

## Why Use MCP?

MCP enables AI tools to interact with external systems efficiently and securely. Some key advantages include:

- **Standardized integration**: Consistent protocol for interacting with APIs and tools.
- **Flexible transports**: Supports stdio, WebSockets, HTTP SSE, and UNIX sockets.
- **Modularity**: Swap models (Claude, GPT, etc.) or tools without rewriting logic.
- **Security**: Keeps sensitive data within your infrastructure.

---

## Project Overview: Claude-Powered PR Review Agent

In this demo, weâ€™ll implement:

- âœ… GitHub Integration: Fetch PR metadata and file changes using REST API.
- ðŸ¤– Claude Desktop Agent: Analyze diffs and suggest improvements.
- ðŸ§¾ Notion Integration: Save review results to a Notion page.
- ðŸ”Œ MCP Server: Provide these tools to Claude via the MCP standard.

---

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Environment Setup

Install the `uv` Python package manager and initialize the project:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv init pr_reviewer
cd pr_reviewer
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install required packages using `uv`:

```bash
uv add "mcp[cli]" requests python-dotenv notion-client
```

Or using `requirements.txt`:

```txt
requests>=2.31.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
mcp[cli]>=1.4.0
notion-client>=2.3.0
```

Then run:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```dotenv
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_api_key
NOTION_PAGE_ID=your_notion_page_id
```

Generate:

- A **GitHub token** from Developer Settings â†’ Personal Access Tokens
- A **Notion integration token** and **page ID** from [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)

---

### Step 4: GitHub Integration Module

Create a file `github_integration.py` to fetch PR data:

```python
def fetch_pr_changes(repo_owner: str, repo_name: str, pr_number: int) -> dict:
    # Uses GitHub REST API to get metadata and file diffs
    ...
```

This module extracts PR title, description, file diffs, patch details, and more using GitHubâ€™s authenticated API.

---

### Step 5: Build the MCP Server

Create a file `pr_analyzer.py` and define a server using `FastMCP`:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

class PRAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mcp = FastMCP("github_pr_analysis")
        ...
```

Register tools:

1. `fetch_pr()` â†’ fetches GitHub PR info
2. `create_notion_page()` â†’ creates a Notion page with Claudeâ€™s output

These tools become available to Claude via the MCP plug icon in Claude Desktop.

---

### Step 6: Run the MCP Server

Start the MCP server:

```bash
python pr_analyzer.py
```

In Claude Desktop, youâ€™ll now see a ðŸ”Œ plug icon and ðŸ”¨ tools interface.

You can input any GitHub PR link, and Claude will:

- Fetch the PR metadata and file changes
- Analyze diffs
- Summarize the PR and optionally upload the result to Notion

## Use Cases and Extensions

This MCP workflow can be extended into many directions:

- ðŸ”„ **Auto-sync PR reviews to Slack or Teams**
- ðŸ“Š **Track review insights in dashboards**
- âœ… **Automate PR acceptance/rejection based on review**
- ðŸ›  **Integrate with Jira/Trello for ticket management**

---

## Conclusion

This tutorial showed you how to create a **modular, AI-powered PR review agent** using **Anthropicâ€™s MCP**, **Claude Desktop**, **GitHub**, and **Notion**. With MCPâ€™s open standard, your tools and models remain decoupled, secure, and scalable.
