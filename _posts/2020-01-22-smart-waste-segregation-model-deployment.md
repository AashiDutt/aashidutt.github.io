Hello everyone. Thanks for continuing with this post. In the last post we saw how to perform data collection and train a machine learning model for image classification. 

In this post, we'll continue with the previously trained model and look at how to deploy that model on Android/Embedded system using TensorFlow Lite. So, let's get started.

# TensorFlow Lite Working in Brief

# Model Conversion

// Cover Concepts regarding Model Compression and Optimization for Size & Latency

# Model Deployment on Android/Embedded Device

# Validation of Deployed Model
