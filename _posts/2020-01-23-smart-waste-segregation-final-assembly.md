Hello everyone. Thanks for continuing with this post. In the last post we saw how to setup communication between Android app and the ESP module over HTTP to send commands to control the bin lids.

In this post, we'll finally bring all the parts together, put in the code for bin lids motor control and complete the project assembly. So, let's get started.

# Arduino Motor Control

# Final Project Assembly and Testing

# Conclusion

Thanks for reading.
