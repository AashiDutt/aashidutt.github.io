**[Read the full article on DataCamp: Google Jules – A Guide With 3 Practical Examples](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/google-jules)**

Learn how to use **Google Jules**, an autonomous coding agent powered by **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, to automate software engineering workflows across your GitHub repository.

---

## What Is Google Jules?

**Google Jules** is a developer agent that clones your GitHub repository into a secure Google Cloud VM, understands the context of your codebase, and executes complex tasks such as:

- Fixing bugs and typos
- Improving documentation
- Refactoring and dependency updates
- Implementing new features
- Generating audio changelogs from commits

Unlike autocomplete tools, Jules acts as a planning-first autonomous agent—proposing structured plans before making multi-step changes and generating pull requests.

## How to Set Up Google Jules

### Step 1: Sign In

Head over to the [Jules website](https://jules.google.com) and sign in with your Google account. Accept the Privacy Notice and continue.

### Step 2: Connect to GitHub

Click “Connect Repository” and authorize Jules to access your GitHub account and repositories. You can selectively authorize specific repos or grant org-wide access.

### Step 3: Launch the Dashboard

Once authenticated, you’ll see a dashboard where you can:

- View authorized repositories
- Create tasks via natural language
- Pause/resume existing tasks

Note: Beta users can perform up to five tasks per day.

## Google Jules: Three Practical Examples

### Example 1: Fix Layout and Improve README

**Prompt:** "Improve the README of this repository by making it more detailed and informative."

Jules analyzed the codebase and improved the README by:

- Adding missing documentation sections
- Including setup instructions for Python environments
- Rewriting unclear segments for clarity and structure

Once approved, Jules created a diff and pushed a pull request. This is perfect for onboarding contributors or enhancing developer UX.

---

### Example 2: Add a New Feature (Spending Trends Tracker)

**Prompt:** "Analyze the codebase and suggest a meaningful new feature aligned with the project’s purpose."

Jules proposed and implemented:

- Data persistence with a CSV file for bill tracking
- Logic to append processed bills and build history
- Hooks for future trend visualizations

Jules executed this plan, generated commit messages, and created a PR—all with minimal user interaction.

---

### Example 3: Generate Audio Changelog

**Prompt:** "Summarize commits from the past 7 days and generate an audio changelog."

Jules:

- Pulled commit history
- Summarized author names and module changes
- Used speech synthesis to generate a `.wav` file

Though the voice output was robotic, the concept is powerful—ideal for async teams, sprint recaps, and onboarding.

## Jules vs. OpenAI Codex

| Feature               | Google Jules                         | OpenAI Codex                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Interaction Style     | Autonomous + Plan-based              | Conversational + Iterative            |
| Agent Architecture    | Gemini 2.5 Pro                       | o3 (Codex-1)                          |
| Task Handling         | Multi-step, Parallel Tasks           | Interactive debugging, one task at a time |
| Pull Request Support  | ✅                                     | ✅                                     |
| Context Awareness     | Full repo clone                      | Scoped to selected files              |
| Use Case Strength     | Long workflows, planning, automation | Live prototyping, inline feedback     |

## Conclusion

Google Jules transforms GitHub workflows by:

- Autonomously fixing layout bugs
- Proposing and implementing full-stack features
- Creating audio commit summaries

As Jules evolves, we anticipate support for richer CI integrations, test coverage plans, and UI previews. For async and structured development, Jules is a game-changer.
