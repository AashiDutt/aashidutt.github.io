**[Read the full article on DataCamp: Mistral Agents API – A Guide With Demo Project](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/mistral-agents-api)**

Learn how to build intelligent assistants using **Mistral’s Agents API** and explore agent creation, tool usage, memory retention, and orchestration. A hands-on **Nutrition Coach** demo ties it all together.

---

## Overview

The **Mistral Agents API** introduces an agentic layer over large language models (LLMs), enabling multi-step tasks, web access, tool usage, and persistent memory across conversations. This tutorial walks through building a **multi-agent AI Nutrition Coach** that:

- Estimates calories using web search
- Logs meals with timestamp
- Suggests the next healthy meal
- Generates a food image
- Offers a **Gradio** frontend for interaction

---

## What Is Mistral’s Agents API?

Unlike simple LLM chat APIs, the Agents API allows:

- **Tool use** like web search, image generation, and custom APIs
- **Conversation memory** to track long-term context
- **Agent handoffs** and multi-agent orchestration

Agents consist of:

- **Instructions** (e.g., "You are a meal-logging coach")
- **Tools** (e.g., `web_search`, `log_meal`)
- **Memory** (conversation history and tool responses)

---

## Core Concepts Explained

- **Connectors**: Built-in tools like `web_search`, `image_generation`
- **MCP Tools**: Custom developer tools exposed as APIs
- **Entries & Handoffs**: Structured message/tool logs and agent delegations
- **Supported Models**: `mistral-medium-latest`, `mistral-large-latest`

## Project Overview: Nutrition Coach With Mistral Agents

The app receives a user’s meal and responds with:

1. **Calorie estimate** via web search
2. **Meal log** with timestamp
3. **Next meal suggestion**
4. **Image generation** of that meal

Users interact with this system through a friendly **Gradio UI**.

---

## Step 1: Prerequisites

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies:

- `mistralai==0.0.7`
- `gradio==4.34.0`
- `python-dotenv==1.1.0`

Create a `.env` file:

```env
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

---

## Step 2: Setting Up Mistral Tools

### Tool registration and configuration

Define schemas, instantiate the Mistral client, and load environment variables in `configs.py`.

### Calorie search agent

`web_search.py` uses Mistral’s `web_search` connector to estimate calories from meal descriptions.

### Prompt-based fallback tools

In `next.py`:

- `estimate_calories()` → fallback calorie estimate
- `log_meal()` → logs user meals
- `suggest_next_meal()` → suggests healthy alternatives

### Image generation

`image_gen.py` uses the `image_generation` connector to render a realistic visual of the suggested meal.

---

## Step 3: Full Nutritionist Pipeline

All tools come together in `agent.py` to:

1. Search or estimate calories
2. Log the meal
3. Suggest a next meal
4. Generate an image

```python
{
  "logged": "Meal logged...",
  "next_meal_suggestion": "...",
  "meal_image": "generated_images/meal_x.png",
  "tools_used": [...]
}
```

---

## Step 4: Creating a User Interface With Gradio

`app.py` connects the backend pipeline with a sleek Gradio interface. The UI allows users to:

- Enter a username
- Describe their meal
- Choose a dietary preference
- View calorie estimate, meal log, next meal suggestion, and image

```bash
python app.py
```
