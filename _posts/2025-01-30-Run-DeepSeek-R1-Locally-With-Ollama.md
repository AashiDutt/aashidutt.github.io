## Why Run DeepSeek-R1 Locally?

Running **DeepSeek-R1** locally offers several advantages:

- **Privacy & Security**: No data leaves your system.
- **Uninterrupted Access**: Avoid rate limits, downtime, or service disruptions.
- **Performance**: Get faster responses with local inference, avoiding API latency.
- **Customization**: Modify parameters, fine-tune prompts, and integrate the model into local applications.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Eliminate API fees by running the model locally.
- **Offline Availability**: Work without an internet connection once the model is downloaded.
