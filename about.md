Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m an **AI Technical Writer at DataCamp**, where I craft engaging content that bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI advancements and learners worldwide. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a **masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science** at **Georgia Institute of Technology**, specializing in **Machine Learning**. With 3+ years of experience spanning tech and non-tech roles, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of contributing as a **Founding AI Engineer** at a health-tech startup and as an **IoT Intern** at a Europe-based startup (**SenseGrass**). These diverse experiences have honed my ability to innovate and communicate in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

Iâ€™m a **Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning (Generative AI)** and a **3x Kaggle Expert**, passionate about sharing knowledge and empowering the AI/ML community. As the **Lead Organizer of the ML Chandigarh community**, I thrive on creating impactful connections and fostering learning opportunities. I also actively contribute through **Medium blogs under Gen AI publications** and **paper/book reading session videos on YouTube**, making complex AI topics accessible to all.

My global perspective is enriched by being part of inspiring communities like **Women at MIT** and **Founderâ€™s Voyage**, which fuel my passion for mentorship and community building. Guiding students, fostering innovation, and contributing to a global AI culture are at the heart of my mission. 

When Iâ€™m not deep into AI, youâ€™ll find me mentoring students, brainstorming the next big idea, or connecting people through technology. Letâ€™s work together to build a future driven by curiosity, collaboration, and transformation! ðŸš€
