I am a AI Technical Writer at DataCamp and a graduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology, pursuing a master's in Computer science (majoring in Machine Learning). I have 3 years of experience combined in both tech and non-tech including working for a Health-tech startup as Founding AI Engineer, and a IOT Intern at Europe based Startup (SenseGrass). I am a Google Developer Expert in ML (Gen AI), a 3x Kaggle expert and lead organizer for ML Chandigarh community. I actively write medium blogs under two Gen AI publications and upload paper/book reading session videos on YouTube as well. I love to guide and mentor students in community building and AI/ML. Apart from my contribution towards Google communities, I am also a part of Women at MIT and Founder's Voyage community which gives me exposure to the global tech culture and mostly AI.
